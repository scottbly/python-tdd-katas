 ### Before you start:
 
>Try not to read ahead.  
>  
>Do one task at a time. The trick is to learn to work incrementally.  This is more about seeing how you work than how fast you work. 
>
>Focus on the pattern of Red->Green->Refactor 
>>(write a failing test, write just enough code to make that test pass, and look for refactoring opportunities)
 >
 >Work how you would normally work day-to-day (ask questions of your pair partner, google, etc) 
## Employee Report:
  
>  
>Youâ€™re building an employee management system of a local grocery store. You must create a report listing what employees are working on a given day.
>  
### Hints:  
 - We'll start with the simplest test case of all employees  
 - Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about  
 - **Remember to pause after each passing test and look for opportunities to refactor your code to increase cleanliness, readability and maintainability**

**Requirement -** The shop is now staying open 10 hours on weekends (8 hours on week days). Employees under 18 cannot make more than $100 a day for tax reasons. If they would make more, do not schedule them for that day.
